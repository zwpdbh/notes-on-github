* Operating system concepts
** common questions
1) Explain the following terms: virtual memory, page fault, thrashing.
2) What is a Branch Target buffer? Explain how it can be used in reducing bubble cycles in case of branch misprediction.
3) Describe direct memory access (DMA). Can a user level buffer / pointer be used by kernel or drivers?
   - Related to Accessing Disks in chapter 6, see figure 6.12
   - DMA is a process happend during the states of a CPU reads/writes data from/to a disk. This process, whereby a device performs a read or write bus transaction on its own, without any involvement of the CPU, is know as direct memory access (DMA).
   - The 3 stage of CPU read a data from disk:
     1) The CPU initialize a disk read by writing a command, logical block number, and the destination memory address to the memory mapped address associated with the disk.
     2) The disk controller reads the sector and performs a DMA transfer into main memory.
     3) When DMA transfer is complete, the disk controller notifies the CPU with an interrupt.
   - A user level buffer can be used by kernel or drivers.

** The Memory Hierarchy
*** Storage Technologies
*** Locality
- Good programs tend to reference data items that are near other recently referenced data items, or that were recently referenced themselves. This tendency, known as the principle of locality.
- temporal locality and spatial locality
*** The memory hierarchy
**** Caching in the memory hierarchy
- cache miss and hit
- relace or evict the blck in the process of overwriting an existing block. replacement policy
- Kinds of Cache Misses
  - cold misses
  - conflict miss
  - capacity misses
- 3 steps that a cache goes through of determining whether a request is a hit or miss and then extracting the requested word:
  1) set selection
  2) line matching
  3) word extraction
*** Cache memories
- Generic cache memory organization
  - cache sets bits
  - cache line bits
  - tag bits
  - block offset bits

** Exceptional Control Flow
Exceptional control flow occurs at all levels of a computer system:
1) hardware level, hardware trigger *exception handlers*
2) operating system level, the kernel transfers control from one user process to another via *context switches*.
3) application level, a process can send a signal to another process that abruptly transfers control to a *signal handler* in the recipient.
*** Exceptions
- Exceptions are a form of exceptional control flow that are implemented partly by the hardware and partly by the operating system.
- An =exception= is an abrupt change in the control flow in response to some change in the =processor's state=.
  - The state is encoded in various bits and signals inside the processor.
- When the processor detects that the event has occurred, it makes an indirect procedure call (the exception), through a jump table called an *exception table*, to an operating system subroutine (the *exception handler*) that is specifically designed to process this particular kind of event.
**** Exception handling
- exception number, some of these numbers are defined by processor, some are defined by operation system kernel.
  - The exception number is an index to the exception table, whose starting address is contained in a special CPU register called the exception table base register.
- exception table, so that entry =k= contains the address of the handler for exception =k=.
- The processor triggers the exception by making an indirect procedure call, through entry =k= of the exception table, to the corresponding handler.
- Exception handler runs in kernel mode.
**** Classes of exceptions
- 4 classes:
  - interrupts
    Exception handlers for hardware interrupts are often called =interrupt handlers=.
  - traps
    - traps are intentional exceptions
    - The most important use of traps is to provide a procedure-like interface between user programs and the kernel known as a *system call*.
    - Executing the =syscall= instruction causes a trap to an exception handler that decodes the argument and calls the appropriate kernel routine.
  - faults
    - Faults result from error conditions that a handler might be able to correct
    - A classic example of a fault is the page fault exception, which occurs when an instruction references a virtual address whose corresponding physical page is not resident in memory and must therefore be retrieved from disk. The page fault handler loads the appropriate page from disk and then returns control to the instruction that caused the fault. When the instruction executes again, the appropriate physical page is resident in memory and the instruction is able to run to completion without faulting.
  - abort
    Aborts result from unrecoverable fatal errors
- system level function = system calls + their associated wrapper functions
- =int= instruction in Linux system to invoke system call directly.
  - All parameters to Linux system calls are passed through general purpose registers rather than the stack.
  - register =%eax= contains the syscall number
  - registers =%ebx=, =%ecx=, =%edx=, =%esi=, =%edi=, and =%ebp= contain up to six arbitrary arguments.
  - =%esp= cannot be used because it is overwritten by the kernel when it enters kernel mode.
*** Processes
- A process is an instance of a program in execution.
  - Every program runs in the *context* of some process. The context consists of the state that the program needs to run correctly.
  - The state includes:
    - program's code
    - data stores in memory 
    - its stack 
    - the contents of its general purpose registers
    - its program counter 
    - environment variables
    - the set of open file descriptors
- The process provides two key abstractions to the application:
  1) the illusion that the program has exclusive use of the processor 
  2) the illusion that the program has exclusive use of the memory system

- logical control flow
- Concurrent flows
  - concurrent flow
  - multitasking
  - time slicing
  - Notice that the idea of concurrent flows is independent of the number of processor cores or computers that the flows are running on. If two flows overlap in time, then they are concurrent, even if they are running on the same processor.
  - a proper subset of concurrent flows is parallel flows, more than one flows are running concurrently on different processor cores or computers.
- Private address space
  - address space
  - Each process provides each program its own *private address space*, in the sense that a byte of memory associated with a particular address in the space cannot in general be read or written by another process.
- User mode and Kernel mode
  - mode bit
  - The only way for the process to change from user mode to kernel mode is via an exception such as an interrupt, a fault, or a trapping system call.
- Context Switches
  - It is a higher level form of exceptional control flow.
  - a *context* for each process
  - scheduling, is handled by code in the kernel called the scheduler 
  - After the kernel has scheduled a new process to run, it preempts the current process and transfers control to the new process using a mechanism called a context switch that:
    1) saves the context of the current process
    2) restores the saved context of some previously preempted process
    3) passes control to this newly restored process
  - Cache pollution and exceptional control flow
*** System call error handling
- use error-reporting function 
- use error-handling wrappers
*** Process control
- =getpid= and =getppid=
**** Creating and terminating processes
- 3 states of a process from a programmer's perspective
  1) running
  2) stopped
  3) terminated
- =fork=
  - In the parent, fork returns the PID of the child.
  - In the child, fork returns a value of 0.
**** Reaping child process
- child process reaped by its parent
- zombie
- A process waits for its children to terminate or stop by calling the =waitpid= function
  #+BEGIN_SRC C
    #include <sys/types.h> #include <sys/wait.h>
    pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options);
  #+END_SRC
  - member of the wait set is controlled by =pid=, if pid = -1, the wait set consists of all of the parent's child process.
  - =options= controlls the default behavior
    - WNOHANG
      Return immediately, useful in those cases where you want to continue doing useful work while waiting for a child to terminate.
    - WUNTRACED
      Suspend calling process, useful when you want to check for both terminated and stopped children.
    - WNOHANG|WUNTRACED
      - Return immediately
      - Checking the exit status of a reaped child using macros
  - Error conditions 
    - =waitpid= returns -1, set =erron= to =ECHILD=
    - If the =waitpid= function was interrupted by a signal, then it returns âˆ’1 and sets =errno= to =EINTR=.

**** Putting processes to sleep
- =unsigned int sleep(unsigned int secs)=
  suspends a process for a specified period of time
- =int pause(void)=
  puts the calling function to sleep until a signal is received by the process

**** Loading and running programs
- =int execve(const char *filename, const char *argv[], const char *envp[])=
  loads and runs a new program in the context of the current process.
- The =execve= function loads and runs the executable object file =filename= with the argument list =argv= and the environment variable list =envp=.
- called once and never return
- Unix provides several functions for manipulating the environment array:
  - =char *getenv(const char *name)=
  - =int setenv(const char *name, const char *newvalue, int overwrite)=
  - =void unsetenv(const char *name)=
    
*** Signals
**** Abstract
- hardware + software to cooperate the fundamental low-level exception machanism
- operating system uses exceptions to support a form of exceptional control flow known as the process context switch.
- This section studys a higher-level software form of exceptional control flow, known as signal which allows the kernel and processes to interrupt other processes.
- Low-level hardware exceptions are processed by the kernel's exception handlers and would not normally be visiable to user processes. Singals provide a mechanism for exposing the occurrence of such exception to user processes.
- A *signal* is a small message that notifies a process that an event of some *type* has occurred in the system. In Linux system, there are 30 different *types of signals* that are supported. 
  =man 7 signal= gives the list
- each signal type <==> some kind of system event
**** Signal terminology
- *sending a signal*
  The kernel sends (delivers) a signal to a destination process by updating some state in the context of the destination process. The signal is delivered for one of two reasons:
  1) The kernel has detected a system event (such as a divide-by-zero error or the termination of a child process).
  2) A process has invoked the =kill= function to explicitly request the kernel to send a signal to the destination process.
- *receiving a signal*
  A destination process receives a signal when it is forced by the kernel to react in some way to the delivery of the signal. The process can:
  1) ignore
  2) terminate
  3) *catch* the signal by executing a user-level function called a *signal handler*.
- *pending signal*, a signal has been sent but not yet received.
  - At any point in time, there can be at most one pending signal of a particular type.
  - A process can selectively *block* the receipt of certain signals. When a signal is blocked, it can be delivered, but the resulting pending signal will not be received until the process unblocks the signal.
  - pending signals <==> pending bit vector
  - blocked signals <==> blocked bit vector
  - The kernel sets bit =k= in pending whenever a signal of type =k= is delivered and clears bit =k= in pending whenever a signal of type =k= is received.
**** Sending Signals
- All of the mechanism of sending signals to processes rely on the notion of a *process group*.
  - Every process belongs to exactly one process group, which is identified by a positive integer process group ID.
  - =pid_t getpgrp(void)= returns the process group ID of the current process.
  - =int setpgid(pid_t pid, pid_t pgid)= change the process group of the process =pid= to =gpid=.
- Sending Signals with the =/bin/kill= Program
- Sending Signals with the =kill= Function 
  =int kill(pid_t pid, int sig)=
  - If =pid= is greater than 0, the =kill= function sends signal number =sig= to process =pid=.
  - If =pid= is less than 0, then =kill= sends signal =sig= to every process in process group =abs(pid)=.
- A process can send SIGALRM signals to itself by calling the alarm function.
**** Receiving Signals
- When the kernel is returning from an exception handler and is ready to pass control to process =p=
  1) If the set of signals which are =(pending & ~blocked)= for process =p= is empty, then the kernel passes control to the next instruction in the logical control flow of =p=.
  2) If that set is not empty, then the kernel will choose some signal =k= in the set and force =p= to receive signal =k=. The receipt of the signal triggers some action by the process. Once the process completes the action, then control passes back to the next instruction in the logical control flow of =p=.
     Each signal type has a predefined default action:
     - The process terminates.
     - The process terminates and dumps core.
     - The process stops until restarted by a SIGCONT signal.
     - The process ignores the signal.
- A process can modify the default action associated with a signal by using the signal function. The only exceptions are SIGSTOP and SIGKILL, whose default actions cannot be changed.
  #+BEGIN_SRC C
    #include <signal.h>
    typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int);

    sighandler_t signal(int signum, sighandler_t handler);
  #+END_SRC
  - if =handler= is =SIG_IGN=, then the signal of type =signum= are ignored.
  - if =handler= is =SIG_DFL=, then the action for signals of type =signum= reverts to the default action.
  - Otherwise, =handler= is the address of a user-defined function, called a *signal handler*, that will be called whenever the process receives a signal of type =signum=.
- Signal handlers are yet another example of concurrency in a computer system. The execution of the signal handler interrupts the execution of the main C routine, akin to the way that a low-level exception handler interrupts the control flow of the current application program. Since the logical control flow of the signal handler overlaps the logical control flow of the main routine, the signal handler and the main routine run concurrently.
**** Signal handling issues
The crucial lesson is that signals cannot be used to count the occurrence of events in other processes.
**** Portable signal handling
- use wrapper function around =sigaction= function.
**** Explicitly blocking and unblocking signals
Blocking a signal means telling the operating system to hold it and deliver it later. Generally, a program does not block signals indefinitelyâ€”it might as well ignore them by setting their actions to SIG_IGN. But it is useful to block signals briefly, to prevent them from interrupting sensitive operations. For instance:
1) You can use the =sigprocmask= to block signals while you modify global variables that are also modified by the handlers for these signals.
2) You can set =sa_mask= in your =sigaction= call to block certain signals while a particular signal handler runs. This way, the signal handler can run without being interrupted itself by signals.
**** Synchronizing Flows to Avoid Nasty Concurrency Bugs
- see page 755, 
*** Nonlocal Jumps
C provides a form of user-level exceptional control flow, called a nonlocal jump, that transfers control directly from one function to another currently executing function without having to go through the normal call-and-return sequence. 
- =setjmp=
  - called once, returns multiple times
- =longjmp=
  - called once, but never returns

   #+BEGIN_SRC C
     int** my2dmalloc(int rows, int cols) {
       int header = rows * sizeof(int*);
       int data = rows * cols * sizeof(int);
