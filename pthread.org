- =tidp=, newly created thread
- =attr=, is used to customize various thread attributes.
- =start_rtn=, the newly created thread starts running at the address of =start_rtn= function.
  - This function takes a single argument, =arg=, which is a typeless point.
  - If you need to pass more than one argument to the =start_rtn= function, then you need to store them in a structure and pass the address of the structure in arg.
